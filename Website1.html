  <h1>Evoworld 2.0</h1>
<h2>OverView</h2>
<p>Our game is based on a earthlike world in which creatures evolved like on earth, except a catastrophic supervolcano eruption caused animals such as the housecat to start to evolve, and the environment is different. Their is an abundance of life, but their are many strong and deadly creatures you must fight. You can pick one of 4 creatures, and some of those creatures have special classes. The game is openworld and extremely difficult. This game is like a mix of Skyrim and Darksouls 3, because of the massive openworld, with many details and alot of creatures of different variety, alot of quests, and the gameplay is extremely difficult.</p>
<br />
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The environment is extreme, The three main types of environments in our world are ocean, desert, and grasslands. The desert has a lot of creatures that store water like camels on earth. The grasslands mainly compose of flions and mice.The oceans are full of sharks, and there are many species of exotic fish, There are also sea turtles but they have gills unlike sea turtles on earth. The oceans only get up to 1 mile deep. Their are many unique natural structures on planet Sofrorth. Their are other more localised environments, such as mountian chains, rivers, and volcanoes. In the ocean. their are small islands you can find rare fruits on. Their are also dungeons made by small humanlike inhabitants of the planet.</p>
<br />
<h2>Creatures</h2>
<p> There are many amazing creatures on Sofrorth. The three most amazing creatures are the flion, the desert tortoise, and the land shark. The flion is a housecat that has turned blue to match the grass, and it developed wings, The wings help the cat to catch prey. The land shark evolved from a great white due to some areas of the ocean getting too shallow. This evolution helped the shark to survive, by enabling it to catch prey on land.The desert tortoise evolved from a galapagos giant tortoise due to drying out islands, and they migrated to a desert due to a land bridge. The desert tortoise has a water sac like a camel so it can survive. And a short human like creature called a Lolo</p>
<br />
   <h2>The Creatures You Can Be</h2>
   <br />
   <h3>The Flying Cat</h3>
   <p>This creature is a good at evading enemies, and using stealth. The flying cat doesnt do much attack damage, but it can fly and is quiet and fast, but the Flying Cat is hard to use, and has extremely low health</p>
   <br />
   <h3>The Land Shark</h3>
   <p>The Land Shark is a tank creature, It has the most base health of any creature, and the highest base attack. This creature has issues with stealth, and can be easily swarmed and killed.</p>
   <br />
   <h3>The Human</h3>
   <p>Overall the best choice, At the beginning of the game, it will be hard  for players who choose the human, they will not have much power, and they will have very little stealth. Smarts are required to use this creature. The human is able to build vehicles and mech suits to make the game easier.</p>
   <br />
   <h3>The Lolo</h3>
   <p>The Lolo is small and agile, it is able to use tools, but is faster and quieter than a human, but with less health</p>
   <br />
   <h2>Classes</h2>
   <br />
   <h3>Warrior</h3>
   <p>The warrior class is a class which boosts attack power and health, but also lowers speed and makes you louder.</p>
   <br />
   <h3>Archer</h3>
   <p>The archer class adds stealth and a bow to your character from the start. This class is best used with Lolo's, and Flying Cat's</p>
   <br />
   <h3>Fighter</h3>
   <p>The fighter class is a class which makes all of your base stats exceed the maximum limit for other classes, but weapons are not able to be used, and armor slows you down more than it does in other classes.</p>
